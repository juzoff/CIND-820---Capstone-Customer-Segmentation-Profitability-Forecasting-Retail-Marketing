# CIND-820---Capstone-Customer-Segmentation-Profitability-Forecasting-Retail-Marketing
This project focuses on customer segmentation, profitability forecasting, and marketing optimization using a comprehensive retail sales dataset to address the challenges of a highly competitive retail landscape. By leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, the project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on transactional and demographic attributes, identify statistically significant features that differentiate these segments, and predict high-value customer clusters for targeted marketing. Through K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), customers are grouped to uncover purchasing patterns, while statistical tests (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square) and Monte Carlo simulation estimate segment profitability under uncertainty, using metrics like purchase frequency and churn risk. Machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multinomial Logistic Regression, are employed to predict high-value segments, with techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and SMOTE addressing feature selection and class imbalance. Implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and scipy on Google Colab, this ***capstone*** project delivers actionable insights for personalized marketing, optimized inventory, and enhanced customer retention, contributing to data-driven decision-making and improved profitability in retail.
